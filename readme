Each component will fetch the data needed to diplay in
 the DOM and then manipulate that state depending on the 
 users' interactions.

 The library provides you with a function named useState() to store the state in a component. The function returns an ARRAY.  The ARRAY contains the inital state value index 0 and a function modifies the state index at 1. 

 The index values are deconstructed into two variables. 
const [ tickets, setTickets ] = useState([])

After the above code is run- you will have two variables with the following values:
1. tickets has a value of an empty array.
2. setTickets has a value of a function.
This is the initial change of state in a component.

There is another function called useEffect() to OBSERVE state. useState() performs the FIRST change in state. 
useEffect(
    () => {
        console.log(tickets) // View the initial state of tickets
    },
    [] // When this array is empty, you are observing initial component state
)
